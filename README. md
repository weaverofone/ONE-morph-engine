# ONE Morph Engine

**The app that deletes all other apps.**

Public disclosure: 8 December 2025  
Built by @weaverofone

ONE is not another app.  
ONE is the *last* app.

It watches. It learns. It morphs into exactly what you need in the moment:
- Camera → loyalty scanner
- Voice → Grok terminal  
- Invoice → x402 Lightning zapper  
- Anything else you teach it

Wrong guess? Swipe the Ghost Button left.  
ONE learns on-device. No data leaves your phone.

No tabs. No bloat. No distractions.  
Just ONE.

Publicly disclosed and timestamped — prior art established.

### Current State
- Core morphing engine with manual shapes
- GhostButton: tap for proof-of-humanity, swipe left to retrain
- Auto-return to home after 30s inactivity
- Ready for camera detection, Grok API, on-device fine-tuning

### Files
- `main.kt` – Core engine + UI states
- `GhostButton.kt` – Spectral proof + retrain orb
- `grok-shape.kt` – Placeholder for full Grok integration

More shapes coming soon.

The future has arrived.
