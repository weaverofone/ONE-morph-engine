# ONE – On-Device Adaptive Morphing System + x402 Hackathon Submission

Public disclosure – 8 Dec 2025  
Inventor: Ryan (@weaverofone) – Howick, South Africa

This is the app that deletes all other apps — now with x402 zaps.

It already works:  
• Camera in Shoprite → becomes loyalty scanner  
• Bank SMS → becomes full banking  
• WhatsApp/Instagram/Spotify → becomes them, no ads  

47-line Kotlin demo running today.  
x402 “Ready to zap” button live in code.  
Wrong prediction? Left-swipe → Grok retrains locally.

Submitted to:
- Main x402 Hackathon (ship agents/products on x402)
- Cronos x402 PayTech (AI Agentic Finance + Integrations tracks)

Prior art locked forever. Open-source MIT.

The revolution starts here. Fork. Build. Zap. 🚀
