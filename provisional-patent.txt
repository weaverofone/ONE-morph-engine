This file serves as timestamped public disclosure of the core novel concepts behind ONE Morph Engine.

Core Inventive Concepts (Intended Future Claims):

1. A mobile application that dynamically and fully morphs its primary user interface and functional behavior in real time based on contextual inference, enabling a single ambient application instance to replace multiple specialized applications.

2. A persistent, minimally intrusive floating control element (referred to as "Ghost Button") that supports dual distinct input gestures:
   • Tap: initiates a proof-of-humanity or device attestation sequence
   • Leftward horizontal swipe: triggers immediate user-directed on-device retraining or correction of the active morphed state

3. Automatic reversion of the application to a neutral "home" state after a configurable period of inactivity, minimizing cognitive load and preserving ambient readiness.

4. A closed-loop on-device learning mechanism wherein explicit user rejection of an incorrectly morphed state ("Wrong? Teach ONE") is captured and used to improve future context classification without transmitting any user data off-device.

5. An extensible shape-shifting architecture that supports seamless transitions between high-variance functional modes within the same running application instance, including but not limited to:
   • Optical loyalty card / QR scanner
   • Conversational AI terminal (e.g. Grok integration)
   • Instant payment processor (e.g. x402 Lightning zap)
   • Arbitrary future tools taught by the user

These concepts are believed to be novel, non-obvious, and useful over existing mobile launchers, assistants, widgets, and context-aware applications.

This public disclosure establishes prior art as of the commit timestamp.
Future formal patent filing may follow.

The future has arrived.
It's called ONE.
