ONE – On-Device Adaptive Morphing System
Public Disclosure – 8 December 2025
Inventor: Ryan (@weaverofone) – Howick, South Africa

Claims (prior art – timestamped forever):

1. A mobile application comprising a single persistent foreground process that dynamically replaces its entire user interface in ≤200 ms with context-specific tools using only on-device sensors, encrypted local history, and quantized LLMs running on the device NPU.

2. The application of claim 1 wherein all inference, training, and UI generation occur exclusively within the device’s Private Compute Core with cryptographic proof that zero user data ever leaves the device.

3. The method of claim 1 wherein the application actively identifies and facilitates permanent uninstallation of redundant third-party applications, achieving ≥90% reduction in installed apps within 30 days.

4. The method of claim 1 wherein incorrect tool predictions are corrected by a single left-swipe gesture that instantly retrains the local model without external communication.

5. A method of operating a smartphone wherein ≥98% of daily user tasks are performed without launching any third-party application or accessing the app store.

This disclosure establishes prior art. Any patent filed on these claims after 8 Dec 2025 is invalid.
